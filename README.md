# HowlEngine
> basically just pygame with some easier stuff

Howl Engine is a 2d game engine written in Python 3.10 with simple syntax and easy to use features.
This was made by a 12 year old, so anyone new-ish should be able to use it with ease (AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY READ THE WIKI)
Based on pygame.

Required libraries (most are built-ins):
os
pygame
threading
time
colorama
